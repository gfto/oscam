OVERCLOCKING
	 Dreambox reader

	  For  SC overclocking set to 600. If mhz is unset or any other value,
	  the default value will be used and behaviour will be standard.

	 Phoenix / Smartmouse reader

	  Overclocking does not work with Windows  and	Mac  OS  X.   Set  mhz
	  equivalent  to  the  frequency of the reader.  OSCam can not set the
	  frequency of the reader.

	 Smargo Smartreader+

	  Set the reader frequency with the native  Smargo  Smartreader+  tool
	  (srp_tools).	Do not set mhz and cardmhz.

       OSCam  tries to set the baudrate automatically.	A standard serial port
       has limited baudrate settings, so SC overclocking might not work.  When
       using a serial reader the best way for overclocking is connecting it to
       a FTDI based USB to serial port adapter.

       If overclocking does not work, verify the  effective  baudrate  in  the
       logfile.   If  it deviates too much from the requested baudrate, the SC
       will not be recognized (no  ATR)  and  the  value  for  mhz  should  be
       adjusted  again.  The higher the baudrate, the more accurate the effec
       tive baudrate can be.
