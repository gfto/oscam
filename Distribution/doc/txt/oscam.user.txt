NAME
       oscam.user - user configuration file for OSCam

SYNOPSIS
       The  user  configuration  file  for OSCam contains user definitions. [account] sections in
       oscam.user are recurring (more than one account).

DESCRIPTIONS
   The [account] section
       user = name
	  account name, required

       pwd = password
	  password for account, required

       description = text
	  description of user account

       hostname = hostname
	  host from which user connection is allowed

       betatunnel = <CAID>.<ServiceID>:<target CAID>[,<CAID>.<ServiceID>: <target CAID>]...
	  define Betacrypt tunneling (max. see CS_MAXTUNTAB in	globals.h).   The  ServiceID  can
	  also be used for wildcarded CAIDs.

	   example: betatunnel = 0100.0001:0200,0300.0004:0500
		    betatunnel = 0600.FFFF:0700

	  Be carefull using abbreviations.

       uniq = 0|1|2|4
	  unique level:

	   0 = disabled (default)
	   1 = only one connection per user is allowed
	   2 = set user to fake if source ip is different
	       (e.g. for newcamd clients with different CAIDs and ports)
	   3 = only one connection per user, but only the last login
	       will survive (old MpCS behavior)
	   4 = set user only to fake if source ip is different,
	       but only the last login will survive

       sleep = minutes
	  time waiting for inactive user, default:none

       sleepsend = 0|255
	  255  =  OSCam client only: stopping requests until next zap, 255 = camd 3.x only: stop‐
	  ping requests until restart of camd 3.x client, default:0

       caid = <CAID>[&<mask>][:<target CAID>][,<CAID>[&<mask>][:<target CAID>]]...
	  limit and mapping of CAIDs, default:all CAIDs with mask FFFF

		   caid = 0200&ffee:0300
		   caid = 0400&ff00:0500,0600
		   caid = 0702,0722
		   caid = 0702&ffdf (shortcut for the example above)

       au = label of reader[,label of reader]...|1
	  AU setting, default:none:

	    label of reader = sending EMMs to specified reader
			      (security issue: clients can see SC data!)
	    1		    = auto AU is sending EMMs to all readers
			      (security issue: clients can see SC data!)

       group = group[,<group>]...
	  user assingment to reader group, default=none, required

       services = [!]services[,[!]<services>]...
	  user [de]assingment to service group, default:none

       ident = <CAID>:<ident>[,<ident>,...][;<CAID>:<ident>[,<ident>,...]]...
	  user assingment to SC specific idents, default:none

       class = [!]class[,[!]class]...
	  user [de]assingment to SC specific classes, default=none

	   example: class = 01,02,!03,!04

       chid = <CAID>:<ChID>[,<CAID>:<ChID>]...
	  user assingment to SC specific ChIDs, default:none

       monlevel = 0|1|2|3|4
	  monitor level:

	   0 = no access to monitor
	   1 = only server and own procs
	   2 = all procs, but viewing only (default)
	   3 = all procs, reload of oscam.user possible
	   4 = complete access

       expdate = <year>-<month>-<day>|<year>/<month>/<day>
	  expiration date for account, default:none

	   example: expdate = 2001-11-21
		    expdate = 2002/12/22

       disabled = 0|1
	  1 = account disabled, default:0

       penalty = 0|1|2
	  level of penalty, default: level of oscam.conf:

	   0 = only logging
	   1 = send fake CWs
	   2 = disbable user temporary
	   3 = send delayed CWs

       failban = 0|2|4
	  mask for IP based blocking:

	   0 = ignore (default)
	   2 = block IP of a disabled account on connecting
	   4 = block IP of a sleeping account while sleeping comes up

       suppresscmd08 = 0|1
	  0  =	tell  camd  3.5x, 3.57x and 3.78x clients not to request again for rejected CAID,
	  service ID and provider ID combination, 1 =  disable, default:0

       keepalive = 0|1
	  0 = disable keepalive  between  server  and  client  for  newcamd  or  CCcam	protocol,
	  default:1

       cccmaxhops = hops
	  maximum hops limit for CCcam clients, default:10

	   -1 = CCcam disabled for this user
	    0 = local SCs only
	    1 = local SCs + 1 hop
	    2 = local SCs + 2 hops
	   and so on

       cccreshare = level
	  reshare level for CCcam clients

	   -1 = use reshare level of oscam.conf (default)
	    x = resharing for direct peer and share level x

       cccignorereshare = -1|0|1
	  CCcam ignore reshare setting:

	   -1 = use ingore reshare level of oscam.conf (default)
	    0 = use ignore reshare setting of server
	    1 = use ignore reshare setting of reader or user

       cccstealth = -1|1
	  CCcam stealth:

	   -1 = use CCcam stealth of oscam.conf (default)
	    0 = use extended OSCam-CCcam protocol
	    1 = behaviour like the original CCcam: no activate partner
		detection and extended OSCam-CCcam protocol, prevent
		other OSCam to detect the server as OSCam server
