                             ======================


1. Compiling OSCam from source
------------------------------

1. Get the lastest sources from SVN
      svn co http://streamboard.gmc.to/svn/oscam/trunk oscam-trunk

2. Create folders:
      cd oscam-trunk
      mkdir build
      cd build

3. Look for compile options in oscam-config.h.
   Enable features with make:
      NAME_OF_FEATURE     - enable feature

   Enable features with cmake:
      -DNAME_OF_FEATURE=1 - enable feature

   Use config.sh to enable/disable features.

   If you use cmake you may use the interface to change build parameters
      ccmake ..

   or specify them on the command line like this:
      cmake -DCS_CONFDIR=/where/is/config/files -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/to/installed ..

4. Build:
      make

5. Install:
      make install


2. Build with a different toolchain (cross-compilation)
-------------------------------------------------------
In short, you need to define the toolchain file on the command line, for 
example:

      cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchains/toolchain-powerpc-tuxbox.cmake ..

For current toolchains and more detailed instructions see
